# Movie Theater Schedule Optimizer

This Git repository contains the project "Aðgerðagreining" (Operations Research) from the course "Aðgerðagreining." The project's name in Icelandic is "Hagnaður af miðasölu í Háskólabíó" and it is implemented in AMPL.

## Project Description

This project involves setting up a schedule for a movie theater over the course of one week. The project description provided a list of 13 movies along with information about each movie. The information included the movie's duration, the expected number of guests on the first day, whether the movie is suitable for children, the day on which the movie can start screening, the minimum number of screenings over the week, and ticket revenue. Various constraints were also given that the schedule must adhere to.

When creating a model for the project, some adjustments were made to the constraints. The constraints in the model accommodate all the details provided with the movies, as well as additional constraints to provide the most accurate solution. The objective was to maximize the movie theater's revenue over the week.

The model was implemented using AMPL and produced results that met all the specified constraints. The total profit for the movie theater over the week was 12,071,833 kr.
